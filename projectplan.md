## <center> **What we would do Differently as a Team Next Time** </center>
---

<br>

* Communicate more as sometimes we Confused the Process as a Team.
* Have all Team members Submit Approvals for each Topic before Merging. This would have helped to alleviate the Merging Conflicts through a shared Feedback / Approval Process.
* Practice GitFlow more to prevent Merging into incorrect Branches.
* **Slowed Down - This would have prevented Random Errors / Issues.**
* Pull - To Local Machine should have been conducted more as sometimes the Branches were out of Sync.
