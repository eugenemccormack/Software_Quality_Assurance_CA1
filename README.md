### **Introduction**
<br>
Code review, also known as Peer Code Review, is a systematic examination of software code. The intention is to find bugs and improve software quality. Code review allows team members maintain a consistency between design and implementation techniques.

### **Why do we code review?**


- Consistent design and implementation
  - Enforces a consistent coding style throughout the project, allowing the source code to be more readable to anyone who might be introduced to the project at any given time during the development.
- Minimizing mistakes and their impact
  - Gives a fresh set of eyes to identify bugs and simple coding errors before the code is pushed to the next step.    
- Ensuring project quality and meeting requirements 
  - Ensures that the scope and requirements of any given software run through the hands of several developers. This serves as a check and balance against different interpretations of the scope of and requirements.

### **Code Review Best Practices**

- When reviewing areas such as style, structure, design, logic and functionality of code it is very important that you know what to look for. A good practice is to keep certain questions in your head as you analyze the code. These questions may be as simple as, do I understand what the code is doing or is the code doing what it is meant to.
- If a coder and reviewer arrive at a disagreement, it is important to know who should win the argument. Many would assume that the more experienced person should have the final say, but adopting a culture where the best argument wins is the best practice. When two solutions are just as good the argument should simply be skipped.
- Never review code for longer than an hour at a time and always review less than 400 lines at a time. After 60 minutes performance is significantly reduced and it will not be your best work. Similarly, when reviewing too many lines at one time, attention to detail is lessened.
- When carrying out a code review, it is important to keep a good relationship between the coder and reviewer. Feedback should be constructive and praise should be given when earned. Mistakes will be made and teammates will be in the wrong, but don't blame or complain as it will get you nowhere. Reviews should be enjoyable and following these practices will make that possible.

### **Conclusion**
Code reviews, when done right, can make code reviews more effective and enjoyable while also benefiting code quality, knowledge sharing and team culture. Every project can benefit from code review regardless of the development style and methodology. When it comes to code reviews it is important to remember that no one is the only person who knows a specific part of the code and code reviews help facilitate knowledge sharing across the code base and across the team

### **Introduction**
<br>

>Coding standards are collections of coding rules, guidelines, and best practices. 

These Standards are a set of streamlined rules that must be followed when developing code. This allows projects maintain structure and consistency while multiple developers working on them. These rules enforce the developers to maintain a well-defined and standard style of code. These rules and normally made by the organization to best suit their type of software they are developing.

### **Why are coding standards important and should they always be enforced**

Without coding standards there would be zero structure and cohesion to a project, this would impede the developer’s ability to work as a team and encourage bugs and errors when work is delegated to multiple developers. However, it is important to remember that 
<br>
> Coding standards are a process, and not a goal
<br>

While it is important to enforce these rules, it is also key to understand that they are not and end goal to strive for. Instead, coding standards should be looked at as a process that Is developed over the course of development and adapted to suit the needs of the project in hand. It is unlikely that any two projects would have the exact same coding standards. While some standards are common sense and used in most projects they could just as easily be replaced by others overtime depending on the need of the project. With this in mind we should consider that while all coding standards are important not all are implacable and should be enforced in every project.

### **Coding Standards Document**
The purpose of a coding standards document is to ensure all code is designed, written, and laid out the same by all contributors. A company’s coding standards guidelines and best practices should be followed by all contributors to code. The purpose is to achieve uniformity. There is no "Right and Wrong" way. Each organization will have their own preferences and techniques that may be unique to the org. Ensuring all contributors are comfortable with the coding standards guideline will result in increase in productivity.

<br>

## **Import topics in a Coding Standards Document**
> Naming conventions

Meaningful and understandable variable names help people follow code they have not written. Avoid the use of digits. Names of functions should briefly describe the reason for the function as briefly as possible
> Indentation

Proper indentation helps improves the structure of the code. It is also more pleasing to the eye allowing readers more ease.
>Length of Functions

Functions should be short and precise where possible. Lengthy functions should be split into smaller tasks
>Global variables

Limit the use of global variables where possible

<br>

### **Conclusion**
In sum, its vital that we understand the importance of coding standards not as a textbook set of rules, but as an adaptive and contingent method that moulds to the needs of the project. Coding Standards excel based on consistency and while some of its strengths come from a level of stability they still constantly need to be revisited and updated. This leads to an ever-growing process that allows developers to ask, not whether coding standards should be enforced, but instead ask how appropriate certain standards are to their given project.
