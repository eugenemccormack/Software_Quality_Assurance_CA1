<br>

Task Estimation in Scrum is used in Software Development to estimate the time it will take for a task to be complete. Task Estimation involves all aspect of the Team from software developers to software testers and requires everyone to work together to achieve the goals set out. Scrum is Agile.
<br>

<br>
The Scrum Team, have Task Estimation Meetings where they estimate the effort required to complete each task in the Task List. The result of this meeting is an Effort Estimated Task List. The Scrum Team uses the Task List to create the Effort Estimated Task List. The Task List is used during Task Estimation Meetings to estimate the effort, people and resources required to complete a task or set of tasks within a Sprint.

## Stroy Points/ Planning Poker

<br>
The most commonly used Task Estimation technique in Scrum is the use of story points. Story points are measurement units for expressing an estimate of the effort required to fully implement a task. There is no set value for a story point. The Scrum Team decides on a value for the story points, wether it be an hour, a day or a week. Stroy points help teams set goals for a period of time and builds unity and commitment to the solution.

Story points are generally based around the Fibonacci sequence.  The Fibonacci sequence is a number sequence where every number is the sum of the previous two numbers, ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. This technique is known as Planning Poker. In Scrum Planning Poker the Scrum team works to create accurate estimates. The team will take a task from the backlog and team members will mentally calculate an estimate. Each team member will then hold up a card with their estimate.
