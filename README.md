### **Introduction**
>Coding standards are collections of coding rules, guidelines, and best practices. 

These Standards are a set of streamlined rules that must be followed when developing code. This allows projects maintain structure and consistency while multiple developers working on them. These rules enforce the developers to maintain a well-defined and standard style of code. These rules and normally made by the organization to best suit their type of software they are developing. 


### **Why are coding standards important and should they always be enforced**
Without coding standards there would be zero structure and cohesion to a project, this would impede the developerâ€™s ability to work as a team and encourage bugs and errors when work is delegated to multiple developers. However, it is important to remember that 
> Coding standards are a process, and not a goal


While it is important to enforce these rules, it is also key to understand that they are not and end goal to strive for. Instead, coding standards should be looked at as a process that Is developed over the course of development and adapted to suit the needs of the project in hand. It is unlikely that any two projects would have the exact same coding standards. While some standards are common sense and used in most projects they could just as easily be replaced by others overtime depending on the need of the project. With this in mind we should consider that while all coding standards are important not all are implacable and should be enforced in every project.

### **Coding Standards Document**
The purpose of a coding standards document is to ensure all code is designed, written adn laid out the same by all contributors. A companys coding standards guidlines and bes practices should be followed by all contributers to code. The purpose is to achieve uniformity. There is no "Right and Wrong" way. Each organization will have their own preferences and techniques that may be unique to the org. Ensuring all contributers are comfortable with the coding standards guidline will result in increase in productivity.
