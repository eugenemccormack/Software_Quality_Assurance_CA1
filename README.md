Task Estimation in Scrum is used in Software Development to estimate the time it will take for a task to be complete. Task Estimation involves all aspect of the Team from software developers to software testers and requires everyone to work together to achieve the goals set out within a set amount of time.

The Scrum Team have Task Estimation Meetings where they estimate the effort required to complete each task in the Task List. The result of this meeting is an Effort Estimated Task List. The Scrum Team uses the Task List to create the Effort Estimated Task List. The Task List is used during Task Estimation Meetings to estimate the effort, people and resources required to complete a task or set of tasks within a Sprint.

The most commonly used Task Estimation technique in Scrum is the use of story points. Story points are measurement units for expressing an estimate of the effort required to fully implement a task. There is no set value for a story point. The Scrum Team decides on a value for the story points, whether it be an hour, a day or a week. Story points help teams set goals for a period of time and builds unity and commitment to the solution.

<br>

Story points are generally based around the Fibonacci sequence.  The Fibonacci sequence is a number sequence where every number is the sum of the previous two numbers, i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. This technique is known as Planning Poker. In Scrum Planning Poker the Scrum team works to create accurate estimates. The team will take a task from the backlog and team members will mentally calculate an estimate. Each team member will then hold up a card with their estimate.

<br>

Task Estimations can allow a Team to determine how much work they should bring into a Sprint. This can allow a team to adjust, correct course, get features and their product to the end-user more quickly. This can lead to a project been delivery on time and not going overbudget. It can also help a Team to stay focused as some work well under time constraints which can enhance the learning ability of the developers.

<br>

Task underestimation can hinder work as it can lead to a worker been overwhelmed by time management which can have an adverse effect on their work. Sometimes Task Estimates can be though as a commitment that has to be carried out however things do not always go according to plan and this can result in a team member feeling mentally exhausted thus effecting their decisions. 

<br>

The time required to complete a Task can differ depending on the developerâ€™s level of expertise and this can make some Task Estimation null and void. It is hard to perceive the result of complex tasks and usually these tasks are underestimated which can skew estimations causing undesirable delays in the project.

<br>

In conclusion, task estimation is a vital step in the scrum process. When carried out correctly, it enables teams to have clear goals and set objectives with time frames to reach them. Task estimation involves everyone and decisions are made together, which is very important when working in a team.
