### **Why do we code review?**


- Consistent design and implementation
  - Enforces a consistent coding style throughout the project, allowing the source code to be more readable to anyone who might be introduced to the project at any given time during the development.
- Minimizing mistakes and their impact
  - Gives a fresh set of eyes to identify bugs and simple coding errors before the code is pushed to the next step.    
- Ensuring project quality and meeting requirements 
  - Ensures that the scope and requirements of any given software run through the hands of several developers. This serves as a check and balance against different interpretations of the scope of and requirements.
