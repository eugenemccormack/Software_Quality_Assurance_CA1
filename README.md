Task Estimation can hinder work as it can lead to a worker been overwhelmed by time management which can have an adverse effect on their work. Sometimes Task Estimates can be though as a commitment that has to be carried out however things do not always go according to plan and this can result in a team member feeling mentally exhausted thus effecting their decisions.

The time required to complete a Task can differ depending on the developerâ€™s level of expertise and this can make some Task Estimation null and void.
